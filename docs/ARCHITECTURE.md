# AaharaConnect architecture

## Current state

`apps/web` is the existing Vite administrator prototype and `apps/mobile` is the existing Expo volunteer/donor prototype. Both still use local mock business data. The Express API has health, readiness, application-user, and one read-only vehicle-assignment projection endpoint; the five domain modules are otherwise unimplemented. A passing build does not mean the business modules are live.

## Approved shape

```text
React/Vite admin UI ─┐
                     ├─ Express /api/v1 ─ pg ─ one Supabase PostgreSQL database
Expo volunteer/donor ─┘         │
         Supabase Auth ─ verified token + server-owned role
                     shared Zod/TypeScript wire contracts
```

Supabase Auth issues email-login sessions. Express verifies bearer tokens through Supabase Auth (`getUser(token)`) and reads the authoritative `app.app_users.role`. The frontends may use Supabase's client SDK only for authentication. All application-data reads and writes go through Express. Do not expose the `app` schema in the Supabase Data API. No service-role key is needed in web or mobile.

The backend is a modular monolith. `server/src/modules/{volunteers,food,pickups,tracking,vehicles}` are ownership boundaries inside the same process. `tracking` is Module 4; the existing `vehicles` folder is Module 5 and remains the sole registry owner. Routes/controllers validate HTTP input, services implement rules and cross-module coordination, and repositories own SQL. Unimplemented endpoints correctly return 404. Authentication, database, migrations, shared contracts, configuration and CI are maintained centrally.

The API clients at `apps/web/src/api/client.ts` and `apps/mobile/src/api/client.ts` remain the single application-data HTTP entry points. Their `api/auth.ts` adapters use one Supabase Auth client per app, pass access tokens to `/me`, and trust the server-owned role. The web Settings page exposes optional administrator sign-in; the mobile sign-in screen has a separately labeled shared-API sign-in when public settings exist. Its original demo sign-in and explicit demo-account path remain available. Business-data mocks stay in place until domain APIs and integration tests exist.

## Dependency direction

- Food owns food facts, donor identity and safety review. It requests a Pickup cancellation through a Pickup service interface when necessary.
- Volunteer owns people availability and team membership, never assignment persistence.
- Vehicle Details Maintenance owns canonical vehicle/driver inventory, specifications, maintenance and availability. It reads current assigned-person IDs through Pickup's projection and does not persist that roster.
- Vehicle Tracking owns consent, active-trip observations, location authorization and retention. It reads canonical vehicles from Module 5 and active assignment/pickup state from Module 3 through reviewed interfaces.
- Pickup owns the shared dispatch, assignment, reservation, vessel/container plan and status workflow. It reads Volunteer, Food, and Vehicle Details capabilities through documented service interfaces and writes only its own tables. `GET /vehicles/:id/assignments` is its read-only projection from canonical assignment records.
- A cross-module operation that must be atomic shares a `pg` transaction client. Modules do not import another module's repository or write its tables directly.
